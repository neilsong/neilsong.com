# forever

i feel like picking a title shouldn't be this hard. i'm probably overthinking every detail of what will forever be the first piece i post to this domain. but it's also a good reflection of what i want pieces on this domain to be: unorganized, unpolished strings of words loosely grouped by my interpretation of a theme.

## 20

recently turned 20, and i've been thinking - just a bit - about the next decade i have in front of me. the usual: strive for a meaningful, excellent career, travel the world (not just jp + kr), become a better person, and get married. but as i keep considering and visualizing this future, i've noted 2 things.

1. it seems like it'll be forever until these items materialize
2. i sometimes wish i could live in those 4 years of high school and 2 years of college forever

the coexistence of and interplay between impatience and nostalgia have always struck me as fascinating. a simple analysis would have me believe that impatience is driven by ambition, while nostalgia is a product of reflection. that's why at any given moment, i feel primarily one of both.

\
in truth, impatience and nostalgia are both the natural end state of a dissatisfaction with the status quo. a desire to either go forward or backward in time to "better" times. but honestly, i'm more interested in this desire to go back in time. i'm sure i will write plenty of pieces on conviction, motivation, passion, and ambition - most of my life has been directed by one or many of these. but maybe it's because i'm taking a gap year, living on my own (relatively), or have finally gathered enough memories, but this desire to reminisce has never existed to the degree that it has recently.

## 18

let's scroll back to the last major life event - right before going off to college. i will never forget august 18, 2023 - the first time i was surprised with a birthday celebration by friends and family. i have never considered my birthday to be special; after all, the difference between the 17th and the 18th is quite literally semantic. but to imagine that friends - both old and new - would come together to celebrate a day that only holds a semblance of significance in relation to myself - perhaps, it _was_ all about the friends we made along the way. and maybe that strong sense of familiarity, convenience, and locality is something i miss dearly now.

\
after i went off to college, everyone scattered everywhere across the country all at once (great movie by the way). not even to mention that, for now, i also won't be reunited with the friends i've made in college. and of course, everyone gets busy in their 20s - so many places to be and things to do. but i would be remiss if i didn't treasure these brief moments we have together. months pass like seconds and years like days. friend, the next time i see you, i hope time has not widened the chasm of distance between us. for the memories i have of us will certainly last forever.

\
is there some sort of fascinating conclusion or nontrivial insight here? most definitely not. after all, how novel can a piece be when its author gave up on choosing its title and defaulted to his "Now Playing"? i can only hope that i have reminded you of some memories and people you haven't thought of in forever.
